## File System Structure

```
0:\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users\
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ username.usr          # User credentials (encrypted)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ username_home\        # User home directory
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ root.usr             # Root user credentials
```

## Security Features

- **Permission system**: Users are restricted to their home directories
- **Root protection**: Root account always maintains admin privileges
- **File access control**: Non-root users cannot access system files

## Development

### Architecture

xzephir is built on the Cosmos framework, which allows C# code to run directly on bare metal. The main components include:

- `Kernel.cs` - Main operating system kernel
- `MIV` - Text editor component
- File system integration using CosmosVFS
